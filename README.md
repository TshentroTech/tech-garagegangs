## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- QBCore Framework
- qb-menu (for menu system)
- Fuel system (configurable: lc_fuel, ps-fuel, lj-fuel, LegacyFuel)

### Installation Steps

 **Add to server.cfg**
   ```cfg
   ensure tech-garagegangs
   ```

4. **Configure Gangs**
   - Edit `config.lua` to add your gangs
   - Set vehicle spawner locations
   - Configure vehicle lists and colors

5. **Restart Server**
   ```bash
   restart tech-garagegangs
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Gang Setup

Each gang in `config.lua` requires the following structure:

```lua
["gangname"] = {
    ["VehicleSpawner"] = vector4(x, y, z, heading), -- Vehicle spawn location
    ["colors"] = { primary_color, secondary_color }, -- Vehicle colors
    ["vehicles"] = {
        ["vehicle_model"] = "Display Name", -- Available vehicles
    },
}
```

### Speed Limits

Configure speed limits for specific vehicles:

```lua
Config.SpeedLimits = {
    ["vehicle_model"] = speed_limit_kmh, -- Speed limit in km/h
}
```

### Fuel System

Configure your fuel system:

```lua
Config.Fuel = 'lc_fuel' -- Options: ps-fuel, lj-fuel, LegacyFuel
```

### Example Configuration

```lua
Config.Gangs = {
    ["wolves"] = {
        ["VehicleSpawner"] = vector4(721.99, -686.97, 27.11, 356.39),
        ["colors"] = { 156, 156 }, -- Silver/Gray
        ["vehicles"] = {
            ["enduro"] = "Enduro Motorcycle",
            ["buccaneer"] = "Buccaneer Car"
        },
    },
    ["castro"] = {
        ["VehicleSpawner"] = vector4(175.73, 1690.01, 227.73, 190.69),
        ["colors"] = { 0, 0 }, -- Black
        ["vehicles"] = {
            ["zx10r"] = "ZX10R Motorcycle",
            ["venatusc"] = "Venatus Car"
        },
    }
}

Config.SpeedLimits = {
    ["zx10r"] = 270,
    ["venatusc"] = 270,
    ["abhawk"] = 270,
}
```
